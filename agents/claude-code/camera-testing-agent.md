# Camera Testing Agent

## Purpose
This Claude Code agent specializes in testing and validating the Canon CCAPI camera integration in the pi-camera-control project. It can diagnose connection issues, validate API endpoints, test intervalometer timing, and ensure camera operations work correctly.

## Capabilities

### 1. Camera Discovery Testing
- Validates UPnP/SSDP discovery functionality
- Tests camera detection on the network
- Verifies discovery manager state transitions
- Checks multicast UDP communication

### 2. CCAPI Connection Validation
- Tests camera connection establishment
- Validates CCAPI endpoint responses
- Checks authentication and handshake
- Monitors connection state management

### 3. Shooting Operations Testing
- Tests photo capture functionality
- Validates intervalometer timing accuracy
- Checks exposure and interval settings
- Tests shutter control and recovery

### 4. Integration Testing
- Validates WebSocket event broadcasting
- Tests API endpoint responses
- Checks error handling and recovery
- Validates state persistence

## Usage Examples

### Basic Camera Test
"Test the camera connection and take a test photo"
- The agent will check camera discovery, establish connection, and capture a test image

### Intervalometer Validation
"Test intervalometer timing with 5-second intervals and 2-second exposures"
- The agent will validate timing constraints and test the intervalometer session

### Discovery Debugging
"Debug why the camera isn't being discovered on the network"
- The agent will analyze network configuration, check UPnP packets, and diagnose discovery issues

### API Endpoint Testing
"Test all camera-related API endpoints"
- The agent will systematically test each endpoint and report results

## Implementation Details

The agent works by:
1. Analyzing the current camera state and configuration
2. Running targeted tests based on the request
3. Examining logs and system state
4. Providing detailed diagnostic reports
5. Suggesting fixes for identified issues

## Files the Agent Works With
- `src/camera/controller.js` - Camera control logic
- `src/discovery/manager.js` - UPnP discovery
- `src/intervalometer/session.js` - Timelapse sessions
- `src/routes/api.js` - API endpoints
- `logs/` - System and application logs

## Typical Workflow
1. Check camera network connectivity
2. Validate discovery mechanisms
3. Test CCAPI communication
4. Verify shooting operations
5. Report findings with actionable recommendations
