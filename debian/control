Description: Raspberry Pi Canon Camera Control System
 Pi Camera Control is an intervalometer and remote control system for Canon
 cameras that support the Canon Camera API (CCAPI). It provides a web-based
 interface for controlling camera settings, taking photos, and creating
 timelapse sequences.
 .
 Key features:
  * Web-based camera control interface
  * Intervalometer for automated photo sequences
  * Dual WiFi mode (Access Point + Client)
  * Real-time camera status monitoring
  * Battery and thermal monitoring
  * Automatic network configuration
  * Systemd service for reliable operation
 .
 This package is specifically designed for Raspberry Pi hardware and
 automatically configures the system for dual WiFi operation, allowing
 the Pi to act as both an access point for direct camera control and
 a WiFi client for internet connectivity.
 .
 Supported cameras include Canon EOS R series and other CCAPI-compatible
 Canon cameras. The system is optimized for astrophotography and long
 exposure timelapse photography.
