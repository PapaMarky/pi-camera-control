## Health Scoring Algorithm

### Component Health Scores
```javascript
function calculateHealthScore(metrics) {
  const scores = {
    system: calculateSystemScore(metrics.system),
    services: calculateServicesScore(metrics.services),
    network: calculateNetworkScore(metrics.network),
    camera: calculateCameraScore(metrics.camera)
  };

  // Weighted average based on component criticality
  const weights = { system: 0.3, services: 0.3, network: 0.2, camera: 0.2 };
  const overallScore = Object.keys(scores).reduce((total, key) => {
    return total + (scores[key] * weights[key]);
  }, 0);

  return {
    overall: Math.round(overallScore),
    components: scores,
    status: getHealthStatus(overallScore)
  };
}

function getHealthStatus(score) {
  if (score >= 90) return 'Excellent';
  if (score >= 80) return 'Good';
  if (score >= 70) return 'Fair';
  if (score >= 60) return 'Poor';
